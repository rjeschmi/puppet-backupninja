# Valid attributes for this type are:
#
#   order: The prefix to give to the handler config filename, to set
#      order in which the actions are executed during the backup run.
#
#   ensure: Allows you to delete an entry if you don't want it any more
#      (but be sure to keep the configdir, name, and order the same, so
#      that we can find the correct file to remove).
#
#   user, dbusername, dbpassword, dbhost, databases, backupdir,
#   hotcopy, sqldump, compress, configfile: As defined in the
#   backupninja documentation, with the caveat that hotcopy, sqldump,
#   and compress take true/false rather than yes/no.
